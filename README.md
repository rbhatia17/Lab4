# Lab4 Argument Framework

# CLAIM Prospective Students should pursue MS in information Systems from Santa Clara University 

I started from the Data Extraction to what is the data i get about MSIS program for Santa Clara University(SCU). 
The first data i found was rankings for MSIS program in California and i found that SCU comes in top 30 schools for this program. I liked the data and went ahead with my visualization but once i made a bar chart i felt if i look for the first time its giving an another image then what i expected of my viusalization. As rankings should be more in a table form then a visualization. 

Then i got the data for student to teacher ratio and the number of students enrolled for this course.
This data showed me that for SCU the student to teacher ratio was 14:1, this is really better as if a professor have less students under them they end up giving more focus on each student and students don't feel neglected.
Then my data showed the number of students enrolled were going down as the rankings of colleges goes down(by this i mean rankings gets better) this tries to say its not easy to get enrolled for good colleges as the competition is much more. 

So, out of the data i got to claim that MSIS program is really good of Santa Clara University. 

I still need more data to make a more strong claim like the GRE, GMAT scores, the salary data for the students who graduate from SCU.
For the next time if i do the same visualization i would go with managing my time and then collecting data and making a visualization an tableau and then iterate with my visualization and data. 
As when you do a visualization you get more idea of what you need, and can explore the data.
